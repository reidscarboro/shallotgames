								<h2><b>Sketchy Sled Concept Art</b></h2>
								<br/>
								<br/>

								<p>Hello Ms. Mendenhall's most amazing artists! My name is Reid, I'm a game developer and a co-founder of Shallot Games. We've been hard at work trying to wrap up one of our games, but we need to put some more characters in the game before we can release!</p>

								<hr/>

								<h3><b>About the game:</b></h3>
								<p>Sketchy Sled, releasing for both iOS and Android. Players will draw lines to guide their characters to the bottom of the mountain, collecting coins and performing tricks along the way. Over the course of playing, players will unlock and level-up characters.</p>

								<hr/>

								<h3><b>What you will be doing:</b></h3>
								<p>You will be fulfilling the role of a Concept Artist. A Concept Artist is responsible for imagining new aspects of the games they work on, and is one of the most creative roles in game development. You all, our most amazing concept artists, will each be imagining and designing a character for Sketchy Sled. These characters can be anything you can imagine: people, animals, robots, aliens, a character with a fish for a head, a person made of candy - anything you can think of! </p>
								<p>
									(Worksheet download at the bottom of the page!)
								</p>

								<hr/>

								<h3><b>Rules:</b></h3>
								<p>1. No pre-existing characters. Batman and Elsa are cool, but we're not allowed to put them in our games :( </p>
								<p>2. No actual people (including yourself!), we need totally original characters!</p>
								<p>3. No words or symbols on the characters.</p>

								<hr/>

								<h3><b>Guidelines:</b></h3>
								<p>1. Use big shapes and lots of color. Because the characters will be pretty small on people's tiny phone screens, it will help your character stand out if you use big shapes and lots of color. Small details (thin lines, detailed patterns, etc) will be too hard to see.</p>
								<p>2. All of our characters will be roughly humanoid, meaning they will each have 2 arms and 2 legs. The real design freedom will be in how you design their head/face. So if you want to make a cat, think about the defining features of a cats head/face (pointy ears, big eyes, etc) and draw those!</p>
								<p>3. The arms and the legs won't be very detailed in the game, so I think a solid color will work best for those.</p>
